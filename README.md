KO81/KO81 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
all my files are free of charge for anyone anywhere. i'm not a high skilled programmer, i just make functions as i go.
for fun i'm currently fighting CSP on my home page :-). have fun while browsing.
sharing som discoveries, i made, or i find interesting.

next project is setting custom style properties to an elemnet without breaking strict style-src attribute (CSP).
looks like i made it, but further testing is needed.
